Nested Loops

Similar to nested if statements, nested loops are also available for use in Java. 
This means that a loop can have another loop inside. This works for any of the types of loops. 
Every time the outer loop runs once, the inner loop runs fully._

For example:_

For(int I = 0; I < 3; i++)
{
	For(int j = 0; j < 5; j++)
}_

The outer for loop will run a total of 3 times. Every time the outer loop runs, the inner 
loop will run fully. In this case, it will run 5 times. In total, the outer loop will run 3 
times and the inner loop will run 5X3 times, for a total of 15 times. This is often useful 
when working with arrays._
