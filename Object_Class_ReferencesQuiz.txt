1. A reference variable is:

A) The name assigned to an object that points to the space in the computer's memory where the object is stored
B) A variable that is used as a reference to the size of the value stored in other variables
C) Necessary in order to use any object that has been instantiated
D) A & C_

D_

2. When a reference variable has been created but does not point to anything
For example: ChessPiece bishop; is called:

A) Non-object reference
B) Null reference
C) Non-pointer reference
D) None of the above_

B_

3. Attempting to use a null reference in the program will cause a:

A) NullPointerException
B) InputMismatchException
C) FileNotFoundException
D) There is no problem with using a null reference_

A_

4. Assuming the equals method has not been overwritten, bishop == null and
bishop.equals(null) have the same function.

A) True
B) False_

A_

5. What will "this" refer to in the following code:
object1 = object2;
object2.doSomething();

A) object1
B) object2
C) doSomething()
D) object1 and object2_

D_

6. 2 reference variables pointing to the same location in memory are called:

A) Twins
B) Sibling references
C) Aliases
D) Similar references_

C_

7. Assume the object has a variable length. Consider the following code:
object1.setLength(10);
object2.setLength(5);
object2 = object1;
object2.setLength(3);

What is the length of object 1?

A) 10
B) 3
C) 5
D) 0_

B_

8. When objects are used as parameters in Java:

A) A copy of the actual parameter is stored in a formal parameter
B) A copy of the formal parameter is stored in the actual parameter
C) A brand new object is made in the formal parameter, regardless of the actual parameter
D) Objects cannot be used as parameters in Java_

A_

9. Passing methods as parameters is similar to an assignment statement. Because
of this, Java methods are called:

A) Passed by reference
B) Passed by object
C) Passed by variable
D) Passed by value_
