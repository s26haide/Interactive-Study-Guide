Problem Solving

When faced with a problem that needs solving, jumping right into it rarely leads to satisfactory results.
People usually come up with a plan before they attempt to solve a problem. 
The Problem Solving Model includes 6 steps that are very useful to figure out the answer to a problem:_
1.	Identify the Problem
	What is the problem to be solved?_
2.	Analyze the Problem
	What information are we given about the problem?
	What assumptions can safely be made?
	What is the person who asked us to solve the problem looking for?
	What do we need to find out about the problem?_
3.	Brainstorm Ideas
	List some possible ideas to solve the problem_
4.	Prioritize Ideas
	List the pros and cons of each idea from step 3
	Choose the best idea you came up with_
5.	List the steps to be taken following the chosen solution
	What needs to be done to complete the best idea you chose?_
6.	Evaluate/Test the solution
	Complete the solution.
	Does the solution solve the problem?
	Does the solution include all of the requirements?
	If the solution does not include all of the requirements, what is missing?
	Go back to step 1 with whatever is missing from the solution._
