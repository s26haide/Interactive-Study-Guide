1. Decision-making is not used very often and it is acceptable to not know how to do it.

A) True
B) False_

B_

2. Decision-making allows the computer to run specific code when the condition is true.

A) True
B) False_

A_

3. There are "    " parts of decision making:

A) 2; The condition and the body
B) 4; The condition, the decision, the body, and the else body 
C) 3; The condition, the body, and the else body
D) 1; The condition_

C_

4. Depending on the condition, the statements in the body and the else body can often be swapped.

A) True
B) False_

A_

5. An else body is necessary in every decision-making code.

A) True
B) False_

B_

6. If there is no else body and the condition is false, the program will:

A) Crash
B) Infinite decision making until the condition becomes true
C) Alert the user that the decision-making segment was skipped but continue to run
D) Continue to run as normal as if there was no decision-making segment_

D_

7. A block of decision-making code can have: "   " if statement; "    " else if statements; "   " else statements

A) 1;5;1;
B) 3;2;3;
C) 1;infinite;1;
D) 1;infinite;3;_

C_

8. An if-statement containing another if-statement is called a:

A) nested if
B) if-if
C) if-in-if
D) All of the above_

A_

9. In a nested if, the inside if-statement will always be checked, regardless of the outside if-statement.

A) True
B) False_

B_

10. Because of the way nested ifs are structured, they are often used to make:

A) Quizzes
B) Games
C) Graphics
D) Checklists_

D_

11. Logical operators return a(n): 

A) Boolean value
B) String value
C) Int value
D) Char value_

A_

12. Which of the following are NOT logical operators?

A) >
B) <=
C) =
D) None of the above_

C_

13. What will the following code output?
boolean boo = false;
if(boo = true)
{
   System.out.println("Hello");
}
else
{
   System.out.println("Hi");
}

A) Hello
B) Hi_

A
Notice that "=" was used in the if-statement instead of "==". This means that the value true was assigned to
boo instead of checking if boo was true, and therefore it will print Hello and not Hi. 
Watch out for mistakes like this._

14. In addition to logical operators, there are also conditional operators. Which of the following is a 
conditional operator?

A) <=
B) <<
C) ||
D) |&|_

C_

15. Which of these is another form of decision-making?

A) logical statements
B) switch statements
C) conditional statements
D) resolution statements_

B_

16. What should you put after every case in a switch statement?

A) A break statement
B) A return statement
C) A print statement
D) A System.exit(0) call_

A_

17. Conditional operators can be used in switch statements. 

A) True
B) False_

B_

18. Iterations are also known as:

A) decision-making statements
B) Repetition statements
C) Loops
D) B & C_

D_

19. Iterations are controlled by:

A) Double values
B) Int values
C) Boolean values
D) Char values_

C_

20. How many different types of loops are available for use in Java?

A) 3
B) 2
C) 5
D) 4_

A_

21. Which of the loops must run at least once?

A) While
B) Do-While
C) For
D) All of the above_

B_

22. If the condition of a loop is unreachable, the loop is called an:

A) Unstoppable loop
B) Boundless loop
C) Infinite loop
D) Interminable loop_

C_

23. The difference between a while and a do-while loop is:

A) There is no difference
B) The loops are completely different and not similar whatsoever
C) The while loop will always run at least once
D) The do-while loop will always run at least once_

D_

24. Which of the following are parts of the header for a for loop?

A) Initialization
B) Condition
C) Increment
D) All of the above_

D_

25. How many times will "Hello" print?

for(int i = 10; i < 0; i--)
{
	System.out.println("Hello");
}

A) 0
B) 10
C) 9
D) 11_

A
Note that the condition is that i < 0, not i > 0. Therefore, the condition is never true and "Hello" is
never printed. Using the wrong logical operator can cause problems, so be careful to use the right one.
